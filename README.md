### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my professional account - for now I won't be doing much on this account.

If you want to contact me best to email me or go to my other github account, as I'm not really active on this one

---

To see the many other things I've made (modding related and other small, random things) go to:

**https://github.com/npc-strider**

You can also contact me at:

ðŸ“§ peterr\[dot]00000\[at]gmail\[dot]com

Edit: reading the TOS I can't have another account :/ SO I'm making this org so that people won't take my username.
